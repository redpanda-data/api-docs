== Contribute

The Redpanda docs are open source, and we welcome your contributions!

Before you add or edit content, consult the Redpanda https://github.com/redpanda-data/docs-site/blob/main/meta-docs/STYLE-GUIDE.adoc[Style Guide] for product documentation guidelines.

To contribute to the Redpanda docs, you have the following options:

|===
|Option|Description

|<<Open an issue>>
|Suggest a change by opening an issue on GitHub.

|<<Contribute content>>
|Make changes directly to the documentation and submit them through a pull request.

|===

=== Open an issue

The Redpanda docs team uses GitHub issues to track, plan, and prioritize tasks. To suggest changes, you can create an issue, which the team will then evaluate:

. Verify whether a similar issue already exists in that repository to avoid duplication.
. Go to **Issues** > **New Issue** to create a new issue.

You have the option to assign the issue to yourself or leave the assignee field blank. The Redpanda docs team triages all new issues and will allocate a writer if one isn't already assigned.

If you are a Redpanda employee, submit doc issues in the Documentation [Jira board](https://redpandadata.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DOC/boards/65).

=== Contribute content

You have two options to contribute to the documentation:

. Directly edit a page on GitHub by selecting **Make a contribution** > **Edit on GitHub** located at the bottom of a documentation page.
. Clone the docs repository to make changes locally on your machine. For a guide, see {url-playbook}/blob/main/meta-docs/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[Submit your first contribution].

Check the open docs issues. If you find an issue you'd like to work on:

- If the issue is already assigned to someone else, please consider another one.
- If the issue is unassigned, add a comment expressing your interest in working on it.
